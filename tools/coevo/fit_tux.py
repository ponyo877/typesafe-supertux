"""Learns a model of Tux from demonstrations (tux-model.mjs).

    uv run --project tools/distill python tools/coevo/fit_tux.py demos.json model.json

demos.json: {"features": [...names], "rows": [[[f1, f2, ...], move, weight], ...]},
the numbers Tux looked at (player-facts.js FEATURES) and the move made there.
A LightGBM classifier learns the move from the numbers, as in distilling a
language model's moves into LightGBM; each row counts by its weight times
the inverse square root of how common its move and its part of the level
are (so rare moves at rare places are not drowned), kept within 0.1 to 10
and averaging 1. The trees go to model.json in the form player-facts.js's
modelMove reads: per tree, nodes [feature, threshold, left, right] with
leaves as negative children.
