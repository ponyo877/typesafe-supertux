// Lets a decision model give orders to the badguys near the player.
// The game side is src/port/jev_bridge.cpp: it calls window.jev_on_state()
// every jev_set_send_interval() seconds and takes orders through
// jev_set_order().
//
// A provider (selected with ?ai=<name>) turns the game state into questions
// and asks a model for
//
//   decide({ state, questions }) -> Promise<{ answers }>
//
// in the shape of TypeSafe's /v1/systemone API, which Laya shares. To run a
// model inside the browser (e.g. Laya on WebGPU, should a prompt ever take
// more inputs than a table can hold), add a provider here; nothing else needs
// to change.
//
// Other URL parameters: ?shield=0 (show Laya's own choices), ?interval=<s>
// (how often the game sends its state), ?speed=<x> and ?pursuit=0 / ?reflex=0
// (rich prompt only), ?options=<JEV_OPT_* bits> (for testing).
